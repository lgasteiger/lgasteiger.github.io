          <h2>Example 4</h2>
            <p>
              Here's what the great jurist Oliver Wendell Holms, Sr. had to say about puns:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return. But if a blow were given for 
              such cause, and death ensued, the jury would be judges both of the facts and of 
              the pun, and might, if the latter were of an aggravated character, return a 
              verdict of justifiable homicide.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Clearly, the dude was not a pun fan.

            Whether you love or hate people who pun, you can't argue with Ron Wolfe, who said
            that <q>A punster is someone who shticks by his word.</q>

            The WHATWG says that using the q element is optional and that 
            <q cite="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-q-element">using explicit quotation punctuation without q elements is just as correct.</q>
